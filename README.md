# FlordiaMugshots
Python script opens new chrome window and navigates to the Orange County mugshot database. Begins search for all suspects with a last name starting with A. Manually opens each link and downloads the base64 encoded png (someone didnt want me doing this lol) and saves it to a folder. script iterates all the way to Z.

Takes 6 hours to run but who cares.

Also found some other accompanying datasets from other counties that should be added to the "notOrangeCounty" folder to train a model to distinguish between the two categories
